# GitHub Finder App Created with React.js

This project was created in order to showcase my learning of React. I am enrolled in a Udemy coure (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/) in order to ensure my basic knowledge of React developement is fully up to date. I plan on uploading my 3 projects made following the course here, as well as one public project I will create on my own.

Project 2 consists of a GitHub Profile Finder App that leverages GitHub API in order to find and visit user's profiles.
